    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite sci-fi movie of all-time. 
    "Interstellar" is a visually stunning and thought-provoking sci-fi epic directed by Christopher Nolan. It has received praise for its ambitious storytelling, emotional depth, and breathtaking cinematography.</p>
    <h3>Next</h3>
    <p>Really cool sci-fi movie. "Next" (2007) is a sci-fi thriller starring Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, and Jessica Biel. 
    The film follows Cris Johnson, a Las Vegas magician who has the ability to see a few minutes into his own future. When terrorists threaten to detonate a nuclear weapon, the FBI seeks his help to prevent the disaster.</p>
    <h3>Inception</h3>
    <p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic. 
    "Inception," directed by Christopher Nolan, is widely regarded as a mind-bending masterpiece that blends action, sci-fi, and psychological thriller elements
